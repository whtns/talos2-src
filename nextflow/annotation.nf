/*
This workflow is the annotation process for the Talos pipeline.

It requires a single VCF, which can be single- or multi-sample. This is then annotated and reformatted for Talos.
The specific annotations are:

- gnomAD v4.1 frequencies and alphamissense annotations, applied using echtvar
- Transcript consequences, using bcftools csq

Both run on a sites-only copy of each normalised shard (all samples dropped), and the resulting INFO
fields are lifted back onto the full-width shard with bcftools annotate - see AnnotateShard.

Everything here is cohort-agnostic and cacheable. Output is the annotated VCF shards themselves -
MANE and ClinVar are applied in the per-run workflow, where the labelling happens.
